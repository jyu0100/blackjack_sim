# blackjack_simulator 
This is a blackjack simulator to see how well a player might do against the house. They say the house always wins but is that true? 

For this program there's the dumb player and the slightly smarter player. 
The dumb player hits based on a coin flip while the slightly smarter player hits if they know they won't bust. 


# Results of running the simulation 
Note: Your results may vary when you run the same code

Dumb player results :

Total games = 136367

Losses = 74471 (54.61%)

Wins = 54269 (39.79%) 

Ties = 7627 (5.6%)

Slightly smarter player results : 

Total games = 133383

Losses = 69016 (51.74%)

Wins = 55813 (41.84%)

Ties = 8554 (6.42%)

# My thoughts on the results 
A good player should be able to beat the house and profit but probably net negative in the super long run.
